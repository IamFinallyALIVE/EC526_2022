(Can ignore OpenMP threads which is essentially the same as OpenACC)

=============== Ok Here is MPI light ==============

 To run  on command line.
bash
module load gcc
module load  mvapich/2.3.3

There is of course a scalar code before MPIing it
g++  scal_hello.cpp -o scal_hello
./scal_hello

mpicc  mpi_hello.cpp -o mpi_hello

mpirun -np  64  ./mpi_hello

Note order of Hello,s 

See lots of nice stuff at

---- Ok can use a script queue by a script ---

by

qsub -l h_rt=0:05:00 -P paralg submit_mpi_hello.sh

http://www.bu.edu/tech/support/research/system-usage/running-jobs/submitting-jobs/

look at it by

qstat -u brower


--- Now Jacobi --

g++ jacob_scal.cpp  -o jacobi_scal   (not gcc?) 

mpicc -lm  jacobi_mpi.cpp -o jacobi_mpi

NOTE: For mpicc on the SCC I had to attach -lm to the compile
instructino and get rid of the C++ "new" syntac for malloc

    x = (double*)malloc(local_size * sizeof(double));
    xtmp = (double*)malloc(local_size * sizeof(double));
    b = (double*)malloc(local_size * sizeof(double));
